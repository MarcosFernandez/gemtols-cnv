3.1) Fast CNV Pipeline
______________________

Fast Copy Number pipeline version. Performing a mapping of the FASTQ sequencing reads against a **masked reference** and using a **configuration reference file** to call copy number values.

.. warning::
    Fast CNV Pipeline does not perform a PCR duplicates filtering. 


3.1.1) FASTQ chopping and fragmentation
---------------------------------------

FASTQ input data can be fragmented in a set of chunks to speed up the mapping process. Each chunk can be mapped in parallel according to the computing resources. 

Furthermore, reads are chopped to 36 base pairs to not loose mapping information around masked regions. By default, the first ten bases are removed because unexpected tendencies of nucletide distribution are usually found. Nonetheless, this pattern should be confirmed through `fastqc`_ analysis. ::

    gemtools fastq-splitter  -f my_fastq_1.fastq.gz -split-times 50 -kmer-length 36 -windowing 36 -first-position 10 -n my_fastq_name --gz --threads 8

.. note::
    If you do not specify ``--single`` to disable read pairing, then is going to look automatically for the second pair file if you only
    specify one file. 
    For that to work, the second file has to end with either ``.2`` or ``_2``, with the file extension ``.fastq`` or ``.txt`` (+ ``.gz`` for compressed files).

3.1.2) Alignment to the masked reference
----------------------------------------

Aligns reads against a *masked reference genome* using `gem mapper`_. Maps in *single en mode*, with the goal of generating a set of mappings to later perform a copy number calling based on Read Depth. ::

    gemtools cnv-mapping -f my_fastq_chop-reads.part-1.1.fq -i my_reference_kmer_mask_mask-fasta.gem -n my_mapping_name  --mappin-stats-json -T 8

3.1.3) Copy Number Calling
--------------------------

Runs `mrCaNaVaR`_  to calculate read depth for a set of different kind of windows spanning all the genome. (Long Windows, Short Windows, Copy Windows). After a GC content correction a copy number call is performed.

It also generates a HTML Pipeline report with different statistics and plots. :: 

    gemtools cnv-call -d /mappings/map-sam/ --conf_file my_reference_pad36_padded-fasta.conf --gz --no-duplications -sample-description description -n my_name
